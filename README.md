Subgroup Detection in Bipartite Graphs. 
The Clustering Coefficient and Community Structure in Bipartite Graphs.

The code for the divisive algorithm based on the edge clustering coefficient was implemented for R language. The main purpose is to detect subgroups in bipartite networks by clustering the networks. It is composed basically by two methods: one to get the edge clustering coefficient for all the edges and another to compare those coefficients, eliminate the edge with the minimum value and repeat this procedure until the number of maximum clusters is reached.
